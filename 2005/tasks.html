      <h1>IEEE Visualization 2005 Contest</h1>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>The theme of the 2005 IEEE Visualization Contest was <em>Rendering
Revolution</em>.  With recent advances in non-photorealistic visualization,
global illumination models for visualization, and multi-modal depictions of
data and visualization parameters, the field stands at the cusp of leveraging
these novel methods for more effective visualization. To encourage this
development, the 2005 IEEE Visualization Contest focused this year on these new
techniques.</p>

<p>There were three tasks for the 2005 IEEE Visualization Contest. Two of the
tasks were independent of the given data set, and were meant as a starting point
for an entries efforts. Each data set had its own third task to better
illustrate how the &quot;rendering revolution&quot; assists in the
visualization of that data. Entries were evaluated on their strengths in
each category individually&mdash;it was possible that a very strong entry in one
category to win over a weak entry over all the categories.</p>

<h3>Interactive Exploration</h3>

<p>For the first task, the goal was to facilitate visualization exploration via
interactive rendering and manipulation of the data. Creative and effective
means to control the novel visualization parameters were encouraged---novel
parameter rendering and manipulation was an aspect of the contest. Specific
sub-tasks of this task were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users must be able to manipulate all salient parameters of the
    exploration directly</li>
    <li>The generation of the novel visualization must be reasonably
    interactive for the given data</li>
</ul>

<h3>Static Presentation</h3>

<p>For the second task, it was assumed that the data had been pre-explored and the goal of
the visualization was to communicate the data's content in one (or a few) static
images. Control of the visualization parameters and interactivity was not
paramount in this setting, but compelling depictions were. In fact, without the
depth and other cues provided by interaction, effective communication of the
visualization was designed to be a significant challenge. Specific sub-tasks
were:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a &quot;journal cover&quot; quality image effectively
    summarizing the content of the given data</li>
    <li>Create a small &quot;story board&quot; illustrating different
    aspects/features of the data effectively</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data-Specific Tasks</h3>

<p>Please see the <a href="data.html">data documentation</a> for information
about the data-specific tasks.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>There were two metrics for evaluation: the <em>completeness</em> of the
supplied visualization and the <em>effectiveness</em> of the visualization.
The effective measure had more weight than the completeness measure&mdash;a
compelling, static rendering of one of the data sets is more valuable than an
interactive and static presentation of both data sets with a less compelling
suite of techniques.</p>

<p>Note that the various tasks for the contests set up competing requirements.
Interactivity is often facilitated by smaller data sets with fewer
visualization primitives, while the static presentation is better served by
higher-fidelity but complex techniques.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Interactive Exploration</h3>

<p>Interactive exploration was evaluated based upon the video submitted as
part of the contest submission. The video was required to show the visualization
&quot;running through its paces&quot;&mdash;i.e., interactively stepping
through the data.</p>

<p>A <em>complete</em> solution to the interactive exploration criterion 
was a visualization capable of rendering at real-time rates (10
frames-per-second) while depicting the entire data set; all the parameters
which control the visualization must have been demonstratably editable. An
<em>effective</em> solution might of had to compromise by sub-sampling the data
either in space or in time or compromise on the rate of interaction or the
amount of exploration afforded.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Static Presentation</h3>

<p>The static presentation was evaluated based upon the submitted
image(s)/storyboard(s) and the corresponding description text. A
<em>complete</em> solution discussed the significant features of the data and
how they were depicted by the visualization. An <em>effective</em> solution
provided a compelling image that is both insightful and intriguing.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Data-Specific Tasks</h3>

<p>This criteria measured how well the novel visualization and interaction
techniques addressed the issues of the specific data sets. A <em>complete</em>
solution visualized all the properties discussed for each data, though all
may not be displayed at once. An <em>effective</em> solution generated
results which effectively communicate the variables under display&mdash;such a
display clearly told the story of what occurred within the data set. This
part of the contest was evaluated based upon the submitted video and
web-page.</p>
