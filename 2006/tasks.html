          <p>The goal of this year's contest is to design a visualization that 
            is effective at answering real domain-science questions on real data 
            sets. The use of existing visualization tools and research prototypes, 
            and combinations of such tools are perfectly acceptible in arriving 
            at an effective design. You will of course want to give credit to 
            those who built the tools you used, but the focus is on effective 
            visualization.</p>
          <h2>Domain-Science Questions</h2>
          <p>We asked the scientists what they want to know about the data -- 
            not how to display it, but what they hope to learn from the visualizations. 
            Here's what they want to know:</p>

            on question 1: </b>The Whittier-Narrows question is based on one of 
            the most important scientific results from this series of simulations. 
            The simulations showed that if the quake breaks from south to north 
            there seems to be a wave-guide effect that channels them off the fault 
            zone into the LA area. They saw large motion in LA (not expected). 
            The waveguide theory is one they are looking at. They are now looking 
            for confirmation in natural earthquakes, and this seems to happen. 
            Nobody has really seen this in a time-varying visualization, and they 
            would love to be able to see it both to further confirm the data and 
            to use as a powerful tool for conveying the usefulness of simulation. 
            The Whittier Narrows area which is east of downtown Los Angeles is 
            near the intersection of I-605 and State Route 19. The Whittier Narrows 
            region appears in this image of the Los Angeles area as a red and 
            pink colored area near the center of the picture to the right (click 
            on it for a larger image).</p>
          <p><b><a href="images/basin_location1.jpg"><img src="images/basin_location1.jpg" width="322" height="167" border="0" align="right"></a>Notes 
            on questions 1,2,5:</b> Several of our scientific questions relate 
            to sedimentary basins. A sedimentary basin can be defined as a depression 
            in the crust of the Earth in which sediments accumulate. If the depression 
            has filled with sediments, the surface of a basin may be flat. Basins 
            can be identified through seismic tomography or drilling. Because 
            a basin is filled with soft material, they typically are less dense 
            than surrounding rock areas. Several seismic studies have indicated 
            that sedimentary basins amplify seismic shaking. There are several 
            sedimentary basins in southern California including the Ventura Basin, 
            the San Fernando Basin, the Los Angeles Basin, the San Gabriel Basin, 
            and the Salton Sea Basin. There is significant interest in understanding 
            earthquake wave behavior in basin structures. A sedimentary basin 
            is typically identified by the density of the material in the basin. 
            Seismologist will identify any region that supports an S-wave velocity 
            (Vs) of 2500 m/s and less as a sedimentary basin. A map of the basins 
            on such an isosurface can be found on the <a href="data.html">Data 
            Description</a> page. A map of the basins on the region boundaries 
            is shown here to the right (click on the image for a larger rendition).</p>
          <p><b>Notes on question 3:</b> What are the possible wave types and 
            how do we tell them apart? Compressional (P), shear (S), Love (surface), 
            and Raleigh (surface) waves are the main ones of interest to the scientists. 
            The first two can be deeper waves and second two occur only at a free 
            surface. A good description of these wave types can be found at <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/waves/WaveDemo.htm">http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~braile/edumod/waves/WaveDemo.htm</a>.</p>
          <h3>Region of particular interest</h3>
          <p>In the end, the scientists care most about what happens at the surface 
            in highly-populated areas (in particular, LA). But they also need 
            to understand how strong waves got there or what was blocking them. 
            Concentrating on the upper 20km of the simulation makes sense so long 
            as this does not mask reflections coming from deeper in the simulation. 
            Visualizations that depict a region including LA and the fault line 
            may capture most of the important action so long as they don't clip 
            out wave behavior that explains what happens in that area.</p>
          <p><a href="images/region_of_simulation.2.png"><img src="images/region_of_simulation.2.png" width="252" height="223" align="right" border="0"></a>The 
            image to the right shows three regions of interest. The largest (red) 
            region shows the extent of the simulation volume. The smaller blue 
            region includes the fault zone as well as most of the basins and the 
            large majority of the populated areas in the simulation region. The 
            smallest box (black) indicates the Los Angeles area including the 
            Los Angeles basin. The two smaller regions are of greatest interest 
            to the scientists for this simulation and visualizations may want 
            to focus on these areas.</p>
          <h2>Judging</h2>
          <p>There are two metrics for evaluation: the the <em><b>effectiveness</b></em> 
            of the visualization and the <em><b>completeness</b></em> of the visualization. 
            An <em>effective</em> solution clearly communicates the variables 
            under display; such a display clearly tells the story of what occurred 
            within the data set and helps an expert viewer answer the domain questions. 
            A <em>complete</em> solution discusses the significant features of 
            the data and how they are depicted by the visualization. It includes 
            legends and color maps to indicate quantitative measurements to an 
            uninformed viewer. It describes the techniques and software systems 
            used to produce the visualization. The effective measure counts for 
            80% of the total points and the completeness measure 20%.</p>
          <h3>Evaluating Effectiveness (80% of total score)</h3>
          <p>The judges for this part of the score will be scientists studying 
            earthquakes.</p>
          <p>Effectiveness on each of the five quesrtions will be evaluated on 
            a five-point scale, with 5 being &quot;I could see the answer immediately 
            and clearly&quot; and 1 being &quot;I know the answer already, but 
            I still can't see it in the visualization.&quot; To randomize learning 
            effects, we intend to have each judge view the submissions in a different, 
            randomly-selected order. Each judge will read the PDF file accompying 
            the submission before judging the video and/or still-image submissions, 
            so that they will be familiar with the techniques and with how the 
            authors believe the visualization is best viewed to answer the questions.</p>
          <p>The total effectiveness score will be the sum of the individual scores, 
            weighted by the relative-importance values placed on the questions 
            (the point scores). These point scores reflect the relative importance 
            of the questions to the scientists, not the relative ease with which 
            each can be displayed.</p>
          <p>The mean total score from all judges will be used as the effectiveness 
            score.</p>
          <h3>Evaluating Completeness (20% of total score)</h3>
          <p>The judges for this part of the score will be practicing visualization 
            researchers.</p>
          <p>Completeness will be evaluated on a five-point scale, with 5 being 
            &quot;I could implement this and get these same pictures and know 
            what settings to put on all of the parameters&quot; and 1 being &quot;I 
            have no idea how to make this picture.&quot;</p>
          <p>The mean total score from all judges will be used as the completeness 
            score.</p>
          <h2>Determining winning entries</h2>
          <p>The final score for each team will be determined by adding 80% of 
            the effectiveness score to 20% of the completeness score. The scores 
            will be sorted from highest to lowest.</p>
          <p>The highest-scoring entry will be evaluated by a group consisting 
            of the current judges, the conference chair, and judges of past contests 
            to determine if it is of sufficient merit to deserve an IEEE Visualization 
            award. If so, the first-place prize will be awarded to the team that 
            submitted this entry.</p>
          <p>The entry with the second-highest score will be similarly evaluated 
            and if it is of sufficient merit the team that submitted it will be 
            awarded second place.</p>
          <p>The entry with the third-highest score will be similarly evaluated 
            and if it is of sufficient merit the team that submitted it will be 
            awarded third place.</p>
          <p><b>Breaking Ties:</b> In the case of identical numerical final scores, 
            the team with the higher effectiveness score will be selected. In 
            the case of identical total and effectiveness scores, the team with 
            the higher score on the question with the largest relative-imporance 
            score will be selected. In the case of identical scores in all questions, 
            a coin toss will be used.</p>
