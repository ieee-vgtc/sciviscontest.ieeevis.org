      <p>A huge &quot;thank you&quot; to everyone for helping get the 2006 IEEE 
        Visualization <br>
        Design Contest ready for announcement now, in time for it to be selected 
        as <br>
        a course project by those who are teaching visualization courses this 
        <br>
        spring. You submitted ideas that got included, provided data, provided 
        <br>
        prizes, or provided beta-testing for the process.</p>
      <p>Please help spread the word!</p>
      <p>I think that early dissemination of the contest will be key to getting 
        the <br>
        word out so that all interested people have time to submit this year.</p>
      <p>The main page can be found at <br>
        http://www.cs.unc.edu/~taylorr/vis06_contest_web_page/. The rules and 
        <br>
        questions and judging are all available now. Example data-loaders and 
        <br>
        displayers are available now, so that people can get started right <br>
        away. This site currently includes a sample time-slice of the data <br>
        set. The full data set is being staged at SDSC as we speak and will be 
        <br>
        linked in as soon as it becomes available (I expect by the end of <br>
        January). The exact submission deadline is still TBD, sometime prior to 
        <br>
        the early-registration deadline.</p>
      <p>Note: The beta-test sites are encouraged to submit, you're not included 
        in <br>
        the organizers for purposes of determining who is <br>
        ineligible. Unfortunately for me, the students in MY vis course can't 
        submit.</p>

      <p>SDSC is hosting the full simulation data set from their FTP site. The 
        link <br>
        on the contest download page now points to the place where they can be 
        <br>
        downloaded. This page is at <br>
        http://www.cs.unc.edu/~taylorr/vis06_contest_web_page/download.html.</p>
      <p>When I tried to download, it went between 2 and 6 Mbits/second, which 
        would <br>
        make a total download time of 1-3 days, so start early and maybe grab 
        a few <br>
        timestamps to start with. I'm working with SDSC to find out where the 
        <br>
        bottleneck is between here and there.</p>
      <p>Happy downloading!<br>

        referring to the vtk_read_and_display_x.tcl script to display an x- <br>
        slice of the wave data, I wonder if a screen shot image of the <br>
        expected result could be posted as well? It would make for a good <br>
        initial sanity check. I ask, in part, because I'm a little confused <br>
        that the script reads in the .bin file instead of the .vtk.</p>

      <p>Good idea. I've put example images (screenshots of the viewer) in the 
        Data <br>
        Description page and pointed to that page in the Downloads page.</p>
      <p>I have the display program read directly from the raw data as an example 
        of <br>
        how to put together a complete VTK pipeline that goes from the raw data 
        to <br>
        a display. The VTK files can be opened directly in ParaView or VolView, 
        <br>
        and there is an example ParaView image on the Data Description page as 
        well <br>
        for a particular set of isovalues and color map.</p>
      <p>By the way, SDSC is compressing the data as I type. The first few time 
        <br>
        slices compress a huge amount, the later ones not so much. Start <br>
        downloading early, because it looks like it will take a couple of days 
        to <br>
        download all of the files at the available bandwidth.</p>

      <p>We've set up a mirror site for the volumetric data sets at UNC. They 
        can <br>
        be found at the following link: ftp://viscontest.cs.unc.edu/. If there 
        are <br>
        only a few people hitting the site at any one time, it should be faster 
        to <br>
        download from the mirror because we don't have a specific limit set on 
        the <br>
        speed. On the other hand, it is a single old slow machine doing the <br>
        transfer so it will be easy to bog it down compared to the SDSC machines.</p>

      <p>Hello everyone,</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I just saw on the contest page that submission should be made in<br>
        physical form, including CDs / DVDs. I was wondering if there is any<br>
        possibility to make the process somewhat more fair to applicants from<br>
        oversea that have a mail delivery time of about 10 days. If our group<br>
        should decide to attend the contest we could offer to host a CD / DVD<br>
        image on our ftp. Also we could send a checksum of the image to the<br>
        commitee by due-date in order to ensure that the data is not altered<br>
        after the deadline anymore.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Thanks in advance, best regards</p>
      <p> - Jens</p>

      <p>Jens,<br>
        Good question! It turns out that I made the POSTMARK DATE be the <br>
        deadline, not the arrival date. Fred Brooks turned me on to this idea, 
        <br>
        which saves a ton of shipping costs because everyone can drop it into 
        <br>
        standard mail (please don't use media mail -- it can take weeks and the 
        <br>
        contest may be over by the time it arrives).<br>
        This was intended to also help make things fair for groups from <br>
        different locations. So long as it is postmarked airmail by that date, 
        <br>
        you're in. I built time in the schedule for the packages to take 10 days 
        <br>
        to arrive from wherever. Thus, some can be reviewed while others are still 
        <br>
        in transit (its not like we can review them all on the say day anyhow).<br>
        I went with physical rather than electronic transmission because <br>
        I've been burned one too many times when trying to submit by having some 
        <br>
        server or link get bogged down right near the submission deadline. Also, 
        <br>
        we'd need to make physical media to send to the scientists anyway for 
        files <br>
        this large.</p>

        Message-ID: &lt;6.1.1.1.0.20060505160100.0461a630@imap1.cs.unc.edu&gt;</p>
      <p>The data sets are decimated by a factor of 4 on each spatial axis and 
        100 <br>
        on the temporal axis, but the description of the voxel size given in the 
        <br>
        data set description and in the data translation scripts did not take 
        this <br>
        into account.</p>
      <p>These have been corrected on the web site and in the example scripts. 
        The <br>
        200x200x200 voxel size from the original data become 800x800x800 in the 
        <br>
        data we have posted, and the 0.011-second time resolution becomes 1.1 
        <br>
        seconds between frames.</p>
      <p>This becomes important when trying to align the voxels with the road 
        data <br>
        or other map data.</p>
      <p>Thank you for MSU for pointing out this discrepancy!</p>
      <p>The web page has now been updated to reflect the correct sizes, and the 
        <br>
        scripts have been edited to take this into account.</p>

        include:<br>
        * The 2-page PDF document<br>
        * Up to five color images of up to 3200x2400 resolution showing the <br>
        visualization answering the questions.<br>
        * At most one Mpeg AVI or Quicktime video file of up to 1024x786 <br>
        resolution and up to 15 minute duration showing the visualization in <br>
        action. This does not have to be recorded in real time.<br>

      <p>Russell,</p>
      <p> One of the largest annual conferences for geoscientists is the American<br>
        Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall meeting every year in December in San<br>
        Francisco. This year, there is a poster session related to the type of<br>
        visualizations being done in this contest. If there is a way to let<br>
        interested parties know about this AGU session, we might get some of the<br>
        people in this contest interested in presenting their work at AGU. Here's<br>
        the information on the AGU Session. Let me know if you have thoughts on 
        how<br>
        to let the visualization community know about this AGU session.</p>
      <p>Thanks,</p>
      <p>Phil Maechling</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>----</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Please consider contributing an abstract and submitting a poster to a 
        Fall<br>
        AGU session called:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>IN11: Visualization of Four Dimensional Geophysical Fields</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>We anticipate a very inter-disciplinary session (many scientific fields) 
        all<br>
        with an emphasis on visualization of time varying volumes of data. The<br>
        project description is below. You can submit an abstract through the Fall<br>
        AGU meeting web site at:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm06/</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Fall AGU this year will be held: 11-15 December 2006, Monday-Friday in 
        San<br>
        Francisco.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Description of Session: We propose a cross-disciplinary poster session<br>
        highlighting the visualization of four-dimensional geophysical fields. 
        This<br>
        includes geodynamo, mantle convection, ocean and atmospheric circulation,<br>
        seismic wave fields, ionosphere and magnetosphere, space weather, and<br>
        others. We seek an emphasis on what scientific knowledge can be brought<br>
        forth by imaginative use of new visualization techniques, as well as<br>
        identification of approaches that can be ported from one discipline to<br>
        another. In addition, we ask authors to describe what non-visual data 
        and<br>
        metadata are required to understand and interpret the visualizations, 
        and<br>
        how this information is provided to the viewer. Authors are also requested<br>
        to specify what logistical and IT support they would require at the poster<br>
        session in order to display their work. Special attention will be paid 
        to<br>
        innovative contributions from both graduate and undergraduate students.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Here are the final submission instructions, which have also been updated 
        on<br>
        the web page. We're looking forward to your submissions!</p>
      <p>So that we can prepare enough judges for the contest, please forward 
        email<br>
        to taylorr@cs.unc.edu if you think that you are going to submit. The<br>
        deadline is to be postmarked by August 11.</p>
      <p>Submissions will consist of a 2-page PDF document describing the solution<br>
        (how the design addresses the scientific questions, which software systems<br>
        and algorithms were used), along with four DVDs (or four sets of CDs) 
        with<br>
        accompanying information including a video demonstration. The discs should<br>
        include: </p>
      <p>* The 2-page PDF document <br>
        * Up to five color images of up to 3200x2400 resolution showing the<br>
        visualization answering the questions. <br>
        * At most one Mpeg AVI or Quicktime video file of up to 1024x786<br>
        resolution and up to 15 minute duration showing the visualization in action.<br>
        This does not have to be recorded in real time. <br>
        * Optional (preferred): Source code for generating the pictures and<br>
        video. This will not be run by the reviewers, but will be archived with 
        the<br>
        contest so that researchers can use on this data in the future. </p>

      <p>What operating systems will the contest entries be evaluated on? I <br>
        developed my entry in ruby-vtk which, in my experience, will not compile 
        <br>
        on windows. It can sometimes be problematic to compile on linux but I've 
        <br>
        built a binary package for Arch linux and I could try to build one for 
        <br>
        whatever distro you have available.</p>

      <p>Apologies in the delay in answering; I have been on travel.</p>
      <p>The source code will not actually be run, as stated on the contest <br>
        web page. The PDF document, images, and video will be the main <br>
        judging materials. You can find the relevant info here:<br>
