      <h1>2006 IEEE Visualization Design Contest</h1>
      <p>Note: There is also a <a href="/2008/">2008 IEEE Viualization Design Contest</a>.</p>
      <p>The 2006 IEEE Visualization Design Contest is designed to foster comparison 
        of novel and established techniques, provide benchmarks for the community, 
        and to create an exciting venue for discussion at the conference.</p>
      <h2><img src="images/region_of_simulation.jpg" width="252" height="223" align="right">Theme 
        and Data Sets</h2>
      <p>The theme for the IEEE Visualization 2006 Contest is <em><strong>See 
        What's Shaking</strong></em>. The subject is the TeraShake 2.1 earthquake 
        simulation data set. The questions come from the team of scientists who 
        are analyzing the results. For more information, please consult the <a href="data.html">data 
        description</a> and <a
          href="tasks.html">tasks and judging</a> pages.</p>
      <h2>Focus on Design</h2>
      <p> The goal of this year's contest is to design a visualization that is 
        effective at answering domain-science questions on real data sets. The 
        use of existing tools and research prototypes, and combinations of such 
        tools are perfectly acceptable so long as they produce effective and useful 
        visualizations.</p>
      <h2>Prizes</h2>
      <p>It is intended that the primary motivation for submitting be the honor 
        of winning the award itself. To maintain the high standard due such an 
        honor, the number of prizes awarded will be determined based on the number 
        and quality of submissions.</p>
      <p>Each member of a winning team will receive an award certificate. The 
        first-place prize, if awarded, will include a single complimentary full-conference 
        registration for IEEE Visualization 2006. The winning team is responsible 
        for determining which person will receive this registration.</p>
      <h2>Submission Information</h2>
      <p>The contest is open to everyone (excluding the contest organizers and 
        judges). Individuals and teams from academia, industry, or elsewhere are 
        encouraged to submit. Students and student teams are highly encouraged 
        to participate. Faculty are encouraged to consider using this as a design 
        project in visualization courses.</p>
      <p>Submissions will consist of a 2-page PDF document describing the solution 
        (how the design addresses the scientific questions, which software systems 
        and algorithms were used), along with four DVDs (or four sets of CDs) 
        with accompanying information including images and a video demonstration. 
        The discs should include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 2-page PDF document</li>
        <li>Up to five color images of up to 3200x2400 resolution showing the 
          visualization answering the questions.</li>
        <li>At most one Mpeg AVI or Quicktime video file of up to 1024x786 resolution 
          and up to 15 minute duration showing the visualization in action. This 
          does not have to be recorded in real time.</li>
        <li>Optional (preferred): Source code for generating the pictures and 
          video. This will not be run by the reviewers, but will be archived with 
          the contest so that researchers can use on this data in the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Concurrent submission to the posters program is not allowed.</p>
      <p>Submissions must be sent to the following address, first-class or airmail, 
        postmarked by Friday August 11th, 2006:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>[Submission closed as of August 11, 2006.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For more information, please check out the mail list archive [now closed] 
        and if you don't find the answer there send email to the moderated mailing 
        list [now closed]. Those planning to submit are strongly encouraged to 
        subscribe to the mailing list [now closed] so that you will receive important 
        updates as they are sent.</p>
      <h2>Anonymity</h2>
      <p>Each team can decide whether to submit anonymously or not. The names 
        of anonymously-submitting teams will not be released to the judges (whether 
        they can deduce this based on the submitted material is another matter). 
        The names of the non-winning anonymous teams will not be released to the 
        public, and the judges will be instructed not to release this information. 
        The names of the winning teams and all non-anonymous submissions will 
        be released to the public when the winners are announced; this is being 
        done to provide the largest possible set of example visualizations for 
        this data set. Even non-winning entries for this set of tasks may be optimal 
        for some other set of tasks, and they are likely to have individual high 
        points.</p>
      <h2>Notification</h2>
      <p>All teams will be notified about their status and prizes before the close 
        of early registration for IEEE Visualization 2006.</p>
