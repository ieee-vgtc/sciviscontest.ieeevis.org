SimVis is an interactive visual analysis technology for multi-variate and time-dependent
3D simulation data on unstructured grids, which has been developed at the 
VRVis Research Center in Vienna, Austria, in the past few years.  The SimVis 
approach to visual exploration and analysis of flow simulation data is based on 
(a) interactive feature specification through interactive brushing in data views 
of various kind (scatterplots, histograms, and others), (b) a smooth approach to 
feature specification (similar to fuzzy classifications), (c) an intelligent way 
of extending and combining brushes to access complex data inter-relations, 
(d) focus-plus-context 3D visualization for spatial orientation, etc. . 
In the course of the Visualization Contest 2004 (IEEE Visualization 2004), 
SimVis has been used to interactively explore and analyze the simulated hurricane Isabel.  
With only a few extensions such as new color maps, for example, and after 
sub-sampling the data to allow interactive visualization on a regular PC, it was 
possible to effectively investigate the high-dimensional and complex dataset.  
With SimVis it is possible to instantly access all the data dimensions, including 
3D space, time, and about a dozen of data attributes concurrently and in an integrated manner.  
<br>
<!--
Below we describe (1) preprocessing steps which enabled the efficient investigation, 
(2) interesting SimVis-opportunities for the interactive exploration and analysis from a methodological stand point, (3) the actual exploration and analysis of Isabel by means of SimVis and our findings, and (4) our own view in how far we met the requirements of the contest as well as conclusions we can draw from this case study.

<!-- The SimVis system is a solution that mainly relies on its ability to provide its
users with highly interactive means of data exploration which is accomplished by
a multiple linked view setup in which different data selections
can be specified, viewed and compared in realtime. The views mainly used in this entry are
multiple scatterplots whose selections can be combined by logical operations
and a 3D rendering view which displays the data items in its spatial context.
-->

The software runs interactively on a standard PC containing the following components:
<br>
CPU: Intel P4 3.0 GHz (800MHz frontside bus)
<br>
Ram: 2GB DDR Memory (400MHz)
<br>
Harddisk: 2x 80Gb in a raid 0 setup
<br>
Graphics Card: GeforceFX 5950 (256Mb RAM)
<br>
<br>
In order to prepare the dataset for the SimVis system it had to be downsampled.
We decided to generate one relatively low resolution dataset (100x100x20)
containing 24 timesteps that was used
during the interactive analysis, which contained all the data channels that
were supplied and additionally the following derived attributes:
<br>
</p><ul>
<li>
horizontal flow angle
</li>
<li>
vertical flow angle
</li>
<li>
flow velocity
</li>
<li>
horizontally normalized temperature
</li>
<li>
horizontally normalized pressure
</li>
<li>
spatial difference of the cloud channel
</li>
<li>
spatial difference of the flow velocity
</li>
<li>
spatial difference of the horizontally normalized temperature
</li>
<li>
spatial difference of the horizontally normalized pressure
</li>
</ul>
<br>
Furthermore we made several additional datasets containing the same attributes
but only one single timestep at a resolution of 250x250x50 to produce the images
that can be seen below. The rendering of those datasets was still interactive at
a framerate of approximately 15 frames per second.
<br>
The video capturing software (Camtasia Studio) that was used to grab the screen during the
visualizations ran in the background on the same PC and was not able to grab all
frames that were displayed in the 3D-rendering view. Thus the framerate
during interactions shown in the video is far less than the actual performance of the system. On
average around 45 frames per second can be achieved in the subsampled dataset
that was used for the interactive demonstration. The update after a data
selection change is roughly 0.5 seconds.

    <td colspan="2"><p> 
The SimVis System supports multiple ways to explore a given dataset. Firstly it 
provides a basic overview over the spatial distribution of the data cells in the 
3D rendering view. Here a transfer function can be applied to one selectable data 
channel. The opacity that is assigned to every rendered data cell is specified by the 
degree of interest that the user has specified for it. This specification of a region
that should be in focus is one of the most central parts of SimVis since interacting 
with the system mostly means refining extending or modifying those regions. This can 
be done in multiple linked views like Histograms and Scatterplots by brushing data items 
that should be emphasized in the 3D view. Besides standard brushing (resulting in a binary classification 
of the data) also smoothly brushing data values is enabled, to account for the 
normally smooth distribution of data values in flow datasets.
<br>
Another approach that can be taken with SimVis to explore and analyze especially 
high dimensional datasets is to use the different InfoVis views, e.g. scatterplots, to 
view the distribution of the already selected data items in different attribute spaces. 
This can help to find correlations and other dependencies that might provide 
interesting and important information.

        This portion stands at the beginning of our exploration and analysis of
the hurricane Isabel. In order to gain a rough understanding of the activity that happened
during the course of the simulation the first feature we selected was the lowest layer of the
dataset with a high interest on the portions that are over land. This was
accomplished by utilizing the data attribute height which represents the
absolute height of the data cell and the height over surface which is computed by
subtracting the surface height from the actual sea level height. The second step
was to overlook the structure of the hurricane and its
surrounding weather by selecting data cells containing some form of clouds as
the second feature that is visible in this video. 
<br>
After the specification of those two features the exploration through the time dimension
can easily be accomplished by stepping through the single timesteps in the 3D
view.
<br>
Now that a basic understanding of the cloud structures has been gained, further
analysis can be carried out by focusing on the question if clouds can be found
in regions of high flow velocity. This can be achieved by simply selecting
portions of the data set that contain high velocity and clouds. Furthermore the
velocity is mapped to color in the 3D view. Again by stepping through the time
dimension, further insight into the data can be gained. It can be shown, that the
clouds surrounding the center of the hurricane are within regions of extremely
high velocities. What can be witnessed as well is a cloud gap in this thick wall
of clouds about 34 hours after the start of the simulation, that will be discussed
later on in more detail.
<br>
After examining those clouds near the center an overview over other cloud
portions in calmer regions of the dataset can be made by now selecting clouds
in cells exhibiting low flow velocity. This selection now clearly shows the 
rainbands that form around the hurricane at three different fronts which will be
discussed in another video more closely. Those clouds can be classified as
Cumolonimbus, which exhibit the typical towering structure with a slight
overcast.

    <td align="left" valign="top">
Now that the structure of the cloud systems has been examined we wanted to take a
look at the factors that lead to or accompany cloud formation. Upwinds are quite
necessary for the generation of the anvil like structure of the Cumolonimbus
Clouds that have been selected at the end of the last video part and so we
changed the flow velocity channel in the scatterplot that selected those clouds
to the vertical wind component w. The thin green line marks the zero axis and
so it can be seen, that our present selection, which is marked as current
entries into the scatterplot, mostly lies above this line. 
<br>
Then the cells exhibiting updraft are selected. In order to concentrate on the 
lower regions of the atmosphere which seems to play a big part in the process of 
cloud creation the selection is limited to those portions of the dataset. Again
the rainbands can be recognized easily. Furthermore the asymmetry of the
updraft regions around the eye are quite interesting. It seems that the gap that
was visible in the high velocity clouds selection from the previous video is
visible here as well. Cloud creation is normally hinderd by downdrafts and for
now we assume, that in this region near the center of the hurricane such
downward winds reduce cloud generation or even dissipate them. In a later
video about up- and downdrafts we will discuss this in more detail.
<br>
Besides the aformentioned phenomenom we were interested in some other commonly
known cloud properties like the existence of supercooled water which should
exist in relatively large quantities in clouds of the proportions witnessed in 
this dataset. To test this we simply set the scatterplot to show the temperature 
and the "qcloud" channel, which describes cloud portions made up of liquid
water. Here we can again test our previous selection against those two new
data attributes by examining the distribution of seleced (red) portions in the scatterplot. We see, that
we already selected some supercooled water, but that the biggest portion of our
selection was above the freezing point, which is marked by the thin green line.
The cause for this is, that we previously limited our selection to relatively
low atmospheric regions. Our new selection will now encompass only the portions
of the dataset containing liquid cloud water in regions below freezing point.
This new selection shows that our assumptions were true and that we can find
large batches of cells that satisfy this criteria at the rainbands and near the
hurricane center a few kilometers above ground. In this height the asymmetry of
the center is again very easily visible.

In this step of the analysis we wanted to get an overview over the fronts that exist within
this dataset and how they evolve over time. First we wanted to focus on the
lower portions of the atmosphere. Along a front air with one
characteristic normally pushes air with another characteristic away which
often results in up and down drafts as one air mass either moves over or forces
itself under another air mass. So we selected data regions where the wind is
either moving up- or downwards and applied the color mapping in the 3D view to
the vertical wind channel. Furthermore we windowed extreme up and down drafts out
by using a custom scale for the color map. Exploring the time dimension with
this selection the front structure can already be seen by looking after brightly
red colored regions. Still the whole visualisation is visually cluttered a lot
since too much of the data is selected. Thus we refined the selection by
additionally brushing regions of high humidity and thereby were able to flesh out
the previous selection. Now the leading warm front and the following cold front
can be seen. Between those two fronts the relatively humid warm sector of the storm
system is visible. Furthermore a third front in the north of the hurricane can
be recognized  which weakens relatively early in the progress of the simulation.

The setup that was already prepared in the previous video can now be used to
explore and analyze the convectional cells within the hurricane since up- and downdrafts 
have been selected and color coded in the 3D view. Updrafts are
represented as dark blue to red and downdrafts green to orange. After removing
the humidity constrain and selecting more height slices of the dataset the
shading function of the 3D view is enabled to additionally clarify the spatial
distribution of the degree of interest the selection imposes onto the data.
Convective cells can now easily be recognized by looking for regions of updrafts
neighboring those of downwards wind movement. 
<br>
By examining the time dimension
the very early generation of a storm cell over Florida can be witnessed, which
takes place even before the main rainbands evolve. Furthermore, this
visualization shows very strong convective bands spiraling out from the center
of the hurricane (and to a lesser degree from the storm over florida). During
our investigation we did not find any phenomenom matching those bands. Still we
wanted to mention it, since those bands are so easily recognizable. 
<br>
In order to gather more insight into the convective activity of the hurricane
near its center we again refined our selection by brushing only cells within a
certain spatial location which resulted in the selection of a slice of
the dataset. By moving the brush in the lower right scatterplot the position of
this slice can be changed interactively. Additionally regions of high velocity are selected and
thus only areas outside the eye can be examined. In this visualization the cause
for the gap in the clouds that was mentioned in the description of the first
video can be seen quite clearly. Air is flowing downward in a very narrow
channel and thus hinders cloud formation at this part of the hurricane. Besides
this, multiple small convective cells can be seen in the selected slice right
next to the eye wall.

The eye of the hurricane is one of the most prominent features of this kind of
storm. Thus it is quite easy to find and select with the SimVis system. In this
video the horizontally normalized pressure data channel is used in combination
with the flow velocity channel to select portions of the data set that make up
the eye of the hurricane by brushing low velocity and pressure regions. The
funnel-like structure of the eye can clearly be seen when the view is tilted a
little. Since the hurricane is a tropical low it has a warm core which is shown
in the following selection on the horizontally normalized temperature and
pressure. Since the shading is not calculated again for the new
selection of the warm center of the storm, the spatial outline of the previous selection
can be compared to the current one.

At the beginning of this video the eye is selected for a better overview over
the dataset. Furthermore vapor is mapped to color in the 3D view. In the first
exploration phase it is quite appearant that precipitation leads to low humidity
and thus a low amount of vapor in the air, as can be witnessed especially above
Florida as the rainbands evolve. Now the actual precipitation is mapped to color
and portions of high precipitation are selected in the top right scatterplot
revealing the actual amount and the heights where precipitation originates at.
Again, as in some of the previous videos, a strong asymmetry around the eye can
be witnessed since the biggest part of our selection lies just a bit north
of the center. In order to gain a better overview of the situation at ground
level the height is limited to the lowest slice of the dataset. Additionally
very high precipitation values that mostly occur in greater heights are windowed
out by using a custom scale for the color map. With this selection the amount of
precipitation can be conveniently tracked over time.

The temperature from ground level to about one km height prooved to be the
most interesting in the course of our exploration, since the most information can
be gained from it. Firstly, this video shows how the degree of interest is
focused on relatively warm and relatively cold portions of the data in the
lowest slice of the dataset. Then the time dimension is analyzed timestep by
timestep. This visualization clearly shows the warm sector, the leading warm
front, and the following cold front of the storm system. Furthermore, the weak
warm front and its slow dissipation north of the storm can be witnessed. Besides
those findings it can also be seen that the air over land is cooling rapidly at
nightfall and is warming up only slowly on the next day. Furthermore the
injection of very cold air into the storm system at landfall quickly cools down
the storm center.

In order to explore and analyze the topology of the flow within the data set
the wind velocity direction was converted into a horizontal and
vertical angle in a preprocessing step. Then the feature specification was
carried out on the horizontal angle by combining six 20 degree wide selections
at -60°, 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240° and 300°. The resulting bands of selected
data now represented areas where the wind moves in roughly the same direction.
To further enhance the perception in the 3D view a circular color map has been
included which contains all fully saturated colors from the HSV color scale.
Pure colors (red, green blue, cyan, magenta, yellow) exactely match the
centers of our six selections and thus can be used to distinguish between the
different bands.
<br>
With this setup the flow within the dataset can be observed and overviewed
conveniently. Vortices and saddle points can be located by looking for points
where all six selected bands meet. In order to distinguish vortices from saddles,
the order of the colors has to be considered. If a vortex lies around the point 
of interest, the different bands, which have to be viewed in a clockwise order,
must be colored like the color scale downwards. To detect whether it is a
cyclonic or anticyclonic vortex the location of the bands has to be checked. A
cyclonic vortex, like the hurricane itself, always has its green band at the
east while anticyclonic vortices have theirs on the west side. Every point of
interest that is no vortex is a saddle.
<br>
With this knowledge we examined the dataset and realized that there
are some vortices and saddle nodes besides the hurricane itself. Those are
rather weak and mostly confined to thin layers of the atmosphere. The only
exception to this is a saddle node and an anticyclonic vortex that can be
witnessed at about 13 km height. The saddle and the anticyclone seem directly 
connected to the main vortex of the hurricane and are also moving together as
time progresses.

To classify the hurricane during the simulated timespan we decided to map the
wind velocity to a discrete colorscale which assigns the categories
of a tropical cyclone to different colors. In order to gain further insight into
the velocity distribution near the center of the storm we used the horizontal wind
direction angle and the horizontally normalized pressure to specify only a slice
of the highest velocity regions. By tracking the hurricane center throughout the
course of the simulated timespan the classification into the different
categories can be easily made by looking up the corresponding entries in this
