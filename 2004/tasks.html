      <h1>IEEE Visualization 2004 Contest</h1>

      <h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>The theme for the inaugural IEEE Visualization contest was <em>visualization
fusion</em>. The goal was to provide tasks which will allow researchers to
showcase their visualization techniques from a wide range of disciplines. Since
the type of information being shown is so diverse, we hoped to encourage
collaboration of researchers from all domains of scientific and information
visualization.</p>

<p>The task for this contest can be summarized in one sentence: design a
visualization which allows <em>interactive</em> <em>exploration</em> of
<em>multiple characteristics</em> of the given <a href="data.html">data
set</a>. The three elements of these tasks are explained in more detail
below.</p>

<h3>Interactive</h3>

<p>The given visualization must be interactive. This means that the user can
manipulate the view, change which time step is being used, etc. in as close-to
real-time as possible. Modern graphics hardware, specialized data structures,
and high-speed, interconnected visualization clusters could all be used for
this sub-task. The task does not specify or limit what type of
hardware/software must be used to fulfill this criterion.</p>

<h3>Exploration</h3>

<p>A task related to interactivity, the designed visualization must not be
static. It must allow the user to change the parameters associated with the
visualization technique in order to gain different understanding of the data.
For example, a volume rendering method must allow the user to change the
opacity map. The specification on how the user is allowed to change parameters
is given; that is up to the system designer.</p>

<h3>Multiple Characteristics</h3>

<p>As the theme for this contest is visualization fusion, we are interested in
visualizations with effectively combine multiple visualization techniques for
the different <a href="data.html#variables">variables</a> in the data set.
Below is a partial list of the types of information that could be extracted
from the data and presented:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hurricane Structure:</strong> The clouds making up the hurricane;
  classification of portions of the hurricane (leading edge, eye, convective
  cells, etc.). How do these change when the hurricane makes landfall?</li>
  <li><strong>Rainfall:</strong> Show the rainfall in the current time step;
  show the cumulative rainfall over the simulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Wind:</strong> Show the strength and direction of the wind
  instantaneously; show the change of wind strength and direction over
  time. Show correlation between cloud formation and wind strength (is the
  cloud within area of maximum wind or not?).</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> Show the instant temperature values over
  the volume; show the change in temperature over the simulation.</li>
  <li><strong>Water Vapor:</strong> Show the concentration of water vapor
  instantaneously and over time (including cloud moisture, snow pellets, etc.).
  How does the vapor relate to the air flow?</li>
  <li><strong>Hurricane Properties:</strong> Show various properties of the
  hurricane. Visualize the changes in hurricane classification over time (e.g.,
  tropical storm, category 5 hurricane, etc.). Depict the direction of the
  hurricane. Depict the area affected by the hurricane. How do these change
  when the hurricane makes landfall?</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list is not inclusive, and not all of the properties discussed
above must be shown concurrently. The characteristics shown, however, must tell
a cohesive story. Do not just try to visualize everything; such visualization
would be hard pressed to communicate anything about the data set.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<p>There are two metrics for evaluation: the <em>completeness</em> of the
supplied visualization and the <em>effectiveness</em> of the visualization.
The effective measure has more weight than the completeness measure&mdash;a
compelling, static rendering of multiple variables is more valuable then an
reasonably interactive system with a less compelling suite of techniques.</p>

<p>Note that the various tasks for the contests set up competing requirements.
Interactivity is often facilitated by smaller data sets with fewer visualization
primitives, while the multiple characteristic criterion suggests more static
but complex techniques. While we would like for submissions to attempt to
handle all the requirements, submissions which focus on their strengths will be
more valuable than incomplete attempts at the entire problem.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Interactivity</h3>

<p>Interactivity was determined by the video submitted as part of the contest
submission. The video should have shown the visualization &quot;running through
its paces&quot;&mdash;i.e., interactively stepping through the time steps and
regions of the data.</p>

<p>A <em>complete</em> solution to the interactivity criterion would have been a
visualization capable of rendering at real-time rates (10 frames-per-second)
while depicting the entire data set. An <em>effective</em> solution might have
had to compromise by sub-sampling the data either in space or in time or
compromise on the rate of interaction.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Exploratory Capabilities</h3>

<p>The exploratory capabilities of the developed system must have been
demonstrated in the video and discussed in the submitted web-page summary. A
<em>complete</em> solution would have allowed all the parameters which control
the visualization to be edited in some manner. An <em>effective</em> solution
would have provided a some sort of advance capabilities to assist the user in
performing this exploration.</p>

<h3>Evaluating Multiple Characteristics Rendering</h3>

<p>This criterion was the most important of the three as it related directly to
the theme of the contest. A <em>complete</em> solution would have visualized
all the properties discussed above; though all may not have been displayed at
once, more than one should have been displayed at a time. An <em>effective</em>
solution would have generated results which effectively communicate the
variables under display&mdash;such a display would clearly tell the story of
what occurred during the hurricane simulation. This part of the contest was
evaluated based upon the submitted video and web-page.</p>
