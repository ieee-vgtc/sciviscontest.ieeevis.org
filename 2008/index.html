      <h1>2008 IEEE Visualization Design Contest</h1>
      <p>The 2008 IEEE Visualization Design Contest is designed to foster comparison 
        of novel and established techniques, provide benchmarks for the community, 
        and to create an exciting venue for discussion at the conference.</p>
      <h2><img src="images/ionization_front_instabilities_fig8.jpg" width="299" height="325" align="right">Theme 
        and Data Sets</h2>
      <p>The theme for the IEEE Visualization 2008 Contest is <em><strong>Multifield 
        3D Scalar Data</strong></em>. The subject is an ionization front instability 
        simulation data set submitted by Mike Norman and Daniel Whalen. They want 
        to understand the formation of galaxies, in particular the effect of &quot;shadow 
        instabilities&quot;, where radiation ionization fronts scatter around 
        primordial gas.</p>
      <p>The image to the right, from <a href="papers/Whalen%20instabilities.pdf">[1]</a>, 
        shows a shadow instability forming in one 2D slice through the data set 
        over time. The scientists have not yet seen a 3D view of the fronts, much 
        less the multivariate views needed to answer their questions. This is 
        your chance to be part of new discoveries about the way the universe formed!</p>
      <p>For more information on the data set and questions the scientists are 
        asking, please consult the <a href="data.html">data description</a> and 
        <a href="tasks.html">tasks and judging</a> pages.</p>
      <h2>Focus on Design</h2>
      <p> The goal of this year's contest is to design a visualization that is 
        effective at answering domain-science questions on real data sets. The 
        use of existing tools and research prototypes, and combinations of such 
        tools are perfectly acceptable so long as they produce effective and useful 
        visualizations.</p>
      <h2>Prizes</h2>
      <p>It is intended that the primary motivation for submitting be the honor 
        of winning the award itself. To maintain the high standard due such an 
        honor, the number of prizes awarded will be determined based on the quality 
        of submissions.</p>
      <p>Each member of a winning team will receive an award certificate. The 
        first-place prize, if awarded, will include a single complimentary full-conference 
        registration for IEEE Visualization 2008. The winning team is responsible 
        for determining which person will receive this registration.</p>
      <h2><a name="submission"></a>Vis Contest Chairs</h2>
      
<p>Russell Taylor (UNC) and Amit Chourasia (SDSC/UCSD)</p>
<h2><a name="submission"></a>Submission Information</h2>
      <p>The contest is open to everyone except the contest organizers and judges. 
        Individuals and teams from academia, industry, or elsewhere are encouraged 
        to submit. Students and student teams are highly encouraged to participate. 
        Faculty are encouraged to consider using this as a design project in visualization 
        courses.</p>
      <p>Each submission should provide four copies of DVD or CD media containing:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A 2-page PDF document describing the solution (how the design addresses 
          the scientific questions, which software systems and algorithms were 
          used)</li>
        <li>Up to five color images of up to 3200x2400 resolution showing the 
          visualization answering the questions.</li>
        <li>At most one Mpeg AVI or Quicktime video file of up to 1024x786 resolution 
          and up to 15 minute duration showing the visualization in action. This 
          does not have to be recorded in real time.</li>
        <li>Optional (preferred): Source code for generating the pictures and 
          video. This will not be sent to the reviewers, but will be archived 
          with the contest so that researchers can use on this data in the future.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Submissions must be sent to the following address, first-class (domestic) 
        or airmail (international), postmarked by August 1, 2008:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <pre>Amit Chourasia<br>IEEE Visualization Design Contest<br>9500 Gilman Drive, MC 0444<br>University of California San Diego<br>La Jolla, CA - 92093<br>USA</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>For more information, please check out the mail list archive and if you 
        don't find the answer there send email to the moderated mailing list. 
        Those planning to submit are strongly encouraged to subscribe to the <a href="https://fafnir.cs.unc.edu/mailman/listinfo/vis_contest_2008">mailing 
        list</a> so that you will receive important updates as they are sent.</p>
      <h2>Anonymity</h2>
      <p>Each team can decide whether to submit anonymously or not. The names 
        of anonymously-submitting teams will not be released to the judges (whether 
        they can deduce this based on the submitted material is another matter). 
        The names of the non-winning anonymous teams will not be released to the 
        public, and the judges will be instructed not to release this information. 
        The names of the winning teams and all non-anonymous submissions will 
        be released to the public when the winners are announced; this is being 
        done to provide the largest possible set of example visualizations for 
        this data set. Even non-winning entries for this set of tasks may be optimal 
        for some other set of tasks, and they are likely to have individual high 
        points.</p>
      <h2>Notification</h2>
      <p>All teams will be notified about their status and prizes before the close 
        of early registration for IEEE Visualization 2008.</p>
