          <p>The goal of this year's contest is to design a visualization that 
            is effective at answering real domain-science questions on real data 
            sets. The use of existing visualization tools and research prototypes, 
            and combinations of such tools are perfectly acceptible in arriving 
            at an effective design. You will of course want to give credit to 
            those who built the tools you used, but the focus is on effective 
            visualization.</p>
          <h2>Domain-Science Questions</h2>
          <p>We asked the scientists what they want to know about the data -- 
            not how to display it, but what they hope to learn from the visualizations. 
            Here's what they want to know, with each question tagged by its relative 
            importance. The questions are ordered from simpler to more difficult 
            to visualize:</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li> 
             <p>(10 pts) The shadow instability forms in the ionization front 
                when it encounters a spherical bump in the gas that is centered 
                on the X axis. Is the instability symmetric around this axis? 
                If not, how is the symmetry broken?</p>
       </li>
        <li>
          <p>(10 pts) Over 100 chemical reactions occur in primordial H and He 
            (many of which are driven by radiation in the I-front) but what most 
            interests those studying first structure formation in the universe 
            is H_2. It allowed primeval gas clouds to collapse and form the first 
            stars before galaxies later coalesced. Where is H_2 most prevalent 
            in the simulation?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>(10 pts) How thick are the first fingers of radiation that break 
            through cracks in the shock? Radiation is present wherever there is 
            ionized gas (H+ or 20,000 K temperatures) while shocked gas is nearly 
            neutral and at temperatures of a only few thousand K (the ambient 
            undisturbed gas is at 72 K).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>(20 pts) Turbulence can be thought of as a cascade of fluid flow 
            from large to small scales that tends to dissipate the bulk motion 
            of flow. What usually triggers the cascade are shear motions in which 
            fluid parcels slide past one another. The magnitude of the vorticity 
            of the flow (defined to be the curl of the velocity field) is a useful 
            measure of shear and indicates where turbulence is likely (the cascades 
            themselves are often so small that numerical simulations do not usually 
            resolve them). </p>
          <p> Turbulence is of great interest to astrophysicists for many reasons, 
            partly because it sets the time scales of star formation in the galaxy 
            today and in the early universe. Stars form when clumps in molecular 
            clouds collapse due to gravity; if only gravity acts, stars would 
            form so quickly that all the gas in the galaxy would have been converted 
            into stars eons ago, with none being formed today. One agent thought 
            to slow star formation to the rates observed in the Milky Way is turbulence, 
            which supports cloud cores against collapse.</p>
          <p> The origin of tubulence in molecular clouds is therefore important. 
            It has recently been suggested that dynamical instabilities in the 
            ionization fronts of massive stars in the clouds stir up turbulence. 
            Is there any evidence of this in the shadow instability?</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <p>(25 pts) Turbulent flows by themselves do not form H_2, only the 
            presence of free electrons can. However, if free electrons are present 
            (as signified by H+ fractions) can turbulence enhance H_2 formation? 
            If so, is it because turbulent eddies create overdensities in which 
            reactions occur more rapidly? If not, is it that even though free 
            electrons are present that the turbulence disrupts H- and H_2+ formation 
            (the key precursors of H_2)?</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>(25 pts) Question 5posed a very specific hypothesis about the cause 
            of turbulence. The broader question of interest, and the one for which 
            visualization offers the most promise of displaying something unexpected, 
            is &quot;What is causing the turbulence?&quot; Can you do an open-ended 
            visualization of all variables to try and help answer this question? 
            This is the &quot;seeing the unexpected&quot; question that will hopefully 
            provide new hypotheses.</p>

          <p><b>Notes on questions 1,3: </b>Ambient gas is very cool (72 Kelvin). 
            Shocked gas is around 2000-3000 K. Ionized gas is much hotter: 20,000 
            Kelvin). Temperature thus indicates where shock waves and radiation 
            are present.</p>
          <p><b>Notes on questions 4,5: </b>There is not a straightforward &quot;turbulence&quot; 
            calculation, but it is known that areas of high turbulence will have 
            high curl (at the scale of the turbulence). Curl can be computed from 
            the velocity field. A description of how to compute curl magnitude 
            and an example curl-magnitude-computing program can be found on the 
            <a href="data.html">data description</a> page. Teams are welcome to 
            come up with their own turbulence-estimating data set derived from 
            velocity; be sure to document the calculation being used.</p>

<h2>Judging</h2>
          <p>There are two metrics for evaluation: the the <em><b>effectiveness</b></em> 
            of the visualization and the <em><b>completeness</b></em> of the visualization. 
            An <em>effective</em> solution clearly communicates the variables 
            under display; such a display clearly tells the story of what occurred 
            within the data set and helps an expert viewer answer the domain questions. 
            A <em>complete</em> solution discusses the significant features of 
            the data and how they are depicted by the visualization. It includes 
            legends and color maps to indicate quantitative measurements to an 
            uninformed viewer. It describes the techniques and software systems 
            used to produce the visualization. The effective measure counts for 
            80% of the total points and the completeness measure 20%.</p>
          <h3>Evaluating Effectiveness (80% of total score)</h3>
          <p>The judges for this part of the score will be the domain scientists 
            who submitted the data and questions.</p>
          <p>Effectiveness on each of the five quesrtions will be evaluated on 
            a five-point scale, with 5 being &quot;I could see the answer immediately 
            and clearly&quot; and 1 being &quot;I know the answer already, but 
            I still can't see it in the visualization.&quot; To randomize learning 
            effects, we intend to have each judge view the submissions in a different, 
            randomly-selected order. Each judge will read the PDF file accompying 
            the submission before judging the video and/or still-image submissions, 
            so that they will be familiar with the techniques and with how the 
            authors believe the visualization is best viewed to answer the questions.</p>
          <p>The total effectiveness score will be the sum of the individual scores, 
            weighted by the relative-importance values placed on the questions 
            (the point scores). These point scores reflect the relative importance 
            of the questions to the scientists, not the relative ease with which 
            each can be displayed.</p>
          <p>The mean total score from all judges will be used as the effectiveness 
            score.</p>
          <h3>Evaluating Completeness (20% of total score)</h3>
          <p>The judges for this part of the score will be practicing visualization 
            researchers.</p>
          <p>Completeness will be evaluated on a five-point scale, with 5 being 
            &quot;I could implement this and get these same pictures and know 
            what settings to put on all of the parameters&quot; and 1 being &quot;I 
            have no idea how to make this picture.&quot;</p>
          <p>The mean total score from all judges will be used as the completeness 
            score.</p>
          <h2>Determining winning entries</h2>
          <p>The final score for each team will be determined by adding 80% of 
            the effectiveness score to 20% of the completeness score. The scores 
            will be sorted from highest to lowest.</p>
          <p>The highest-scoring entry will be evaluated by a group consisting 
            of the current judges, the conference chair, and judges of past contests 
            to determine if it is of sufficient merit to deserve an IEEE Visualization 
            award. If so, the first-place prize will be awarded to the team that 
            submitted this entry.</p>
          <p>The entry with the second-highest score will be similarly evaluated 
            and if it is of sufficient merit the team that submitted it will be 
            awarded second place.</p>
          <p>The entry with the third-highest score will be similarly evaluated 
            and if it is of sufficient merit the team that submitted it will be 
            awarded third place.</p>
          <p><b>Breaking Ties:</b> In the case of identical numerical final scores, 
            the team with the higher effectiveness score will be selected. In 
            the case of identical total and effectiveness scores, the team with 
            the higher score on the question with the largest relative-imporance 
            score will be selected. In the case of identical scores in all questions, 
            a coin toss will be used.</p>
